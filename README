Installation
------------

You must have a web server and PHP available in order to use this
demo. To install, run the following command in a directory that is being
served by your Apache web server:

   git clone git://github.com/digitalbazaar/payswarm-news-demo.git news

Configuration
-------------

1. Copy the config.inc.example file to a file named config.inc.

2. Modify the config.inc file and change the following values to work with your 
Apache setup:

MYSITE.COM
   The name of your website, such as example.org
RELATIVE/PATH/TO/THIS/DIRECTORY
   The path to this directory on the web server
YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY - 
   A consumer key, as issued via the PaySwarm developer site. You can get a key 
   by going to the following URL: 
   https://dev.payswarm.com:19443/home/clients/new
YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET
   The corresponding consumer secret issued for the consumer key via the 
   PaySwarm developer site. You can view your key secrets by going to the 
   following URL: https://dev.payswarm.com:19443/home/clients

3. Edit the .htaccess file and set the last rewrite rule to redirect to the 
proper URL on your web server.

4. Make sure that you have the OAuth module installed for PHP:

http://pecl.php.net/package/oauth

To install OAuth must have the PHP 'pecl' program installed on your system. 
Once you have pecl installed, run the following command:

   pecl install oauth

Once these steps have been completed, the demo should work for you.
