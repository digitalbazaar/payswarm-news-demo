Prerequisites
-------------

You will need the following software:

- Apache2
- PHP5
- Sqlite3
- PHP5-Sqlite (PDO driver for Sqlite3)
- Pecl (PHP package manager)
- Oauth Pecl Module (Installed through Pecl)

Installation
------------

You must have a web server and PHP available in order to use this
demo. To install, run the following command in a directory that is being
served by your Apache web server:

   git clone git://github.com/digitalbazaar/payswarm-news-demo.git news

Configuration
-------------

1. Copy the config.inc.example file to a file named config.inc.

2. Modify the config.inc file and change the following values to work with your 
Apache setup:

MYSITE.COM
   The name of your website, such as example.org
RELATIVE/PATH/TO/THIS/DIRECTORY
   The path to this directory on the web server. Assuming the demonstration
   path that you are serving is http://example.org/demos/news, then this value
   should be "demos/news".
YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY - 
   A consumer key, as issued via the PaySwarm developer site. You can get a key 
   by going to the following URL: 
   https://dev.payswarm.com:19443/home/clients/new
YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET
   The corresponding consumer secret issued for the consumer key via the 
   PaySwarm developer site. You can view your key secrets by going to the 
   following URL: https://dev.payswarm.com:19443/home/clients

3. Edit the .htaccess file and set the last rewrite rule to redirect to the
relative path of the previews page. For example: /demos/news/

4. Make sure that you have the OAuth module installed for PHP:

http://pecl.php.net/package/oauth

To install OAuth must have the PHP 'pecl' program installed on your system. 
Once you have pecl installed, run the following command:

   pecl install oauth

You should add "extension=oauth.so" to /etc/php5/apache2/conf.d/oauth.ini,
then restart Apache.

Once these steps have been completed, the demo should work for you.
