Installation
------------

You must have a web server and PHP available in order to use this
demo. To install, run the following command in a directory that is being
served by your Apache web server:

git clone git://github.com/digitalbazaar/payswarm-news-demo.git news

Configuration
-------------

You must copy the config.inc.example file to a file named config.inc.
You must modify the config.inc file and change the following values to
work with your Apache setup:

MYSITE.COM - The name of your website, such as example.org
RELATIVE/PATH/TO/THIS/DIRECTORY - The path to this directory on the web server
YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY - A consumer key, as issued via the PaySwarm developer site.
YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET - The corresponding consumer secret issued for the
                       consumer key via the PaySwarm developer site.

You must also edit the .htaccess file and set the last rewrite rule to
redirect to the proper URL.

Once these items have been updated, the demo should work for you.
