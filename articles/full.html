      <h2><span>PaySwarm for Content Creators</span></h2>

      <p>The PaySwarm standard has a number of features that are
      beneficial to content creators:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="#easy">Easy to deploy</a> into Drupal, Wordpress, and other content systems.</li>
        <li>Much more <a href="#secure">secure and safe</a> than credit-cards</li>
        <li><a href="#simple">Simple</a> customer experience.</li>
        <li><a href="#flexible">Flexible payments</a> from $0.00001 to thousands of dollars.</li>
        <li><a href="#open">Based on open standards</a> like HTTP, TLS, and OAuth.</li>
        <li>PaySwarm itself is an open, patent and <a href="#royalty-free">royalty-free standard</a>.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This site is a demonstration of the PaySwarm technology. You won't be
      charged anything to use this site. It is provided merely to demonstrate
      the customer experience that is achievable via PaySwarm.</p>

      <p>You must have a valid PaySwarm account via a PaySwarm Provider. A
      PaySwarm account is much like a bank account. You deposit money into it
      and approve charges to it when you purchase content on the Web, much like
      you use a debit card. Since PaySwarm is an open standard, you choose
      your PaySwarm Provider and any PaySwarm-compliant website will work
      with your provider.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="benefits" class="section">
      <h2><span>The Benefits</span></h2>

      <p>Using PaySwarm benefits Content Creators in a number of different
      ways, some of which are outlined in the following sections.

      <h3 id="easy">Easy Deployment</h3>

      <p>Deploying PaySwarm into existing Content Management Systems (CMS) like
      Drupal, Wordpress or Joomla is easy. PaySwarm purchasing and digital
      contract retrieval can be done using standard OAuth libraries in under
      a hundred lines of code. Because PaySwarm is built on top of the OAuth
      standard, which is used by Twitter, Google, Netflix, and Yahoo, there are
      many libraries in many different languages to choose from when it comes
      to implementing PaySwarm.
      </p>

      <h3 id="secure">Secure Financial Transactions</h3>

      <p>PaySwarm is built around the concept of a Payment Token, which provides
      much stronger financial protections than a credit card or debit card
      when used online. A Payment
      Token is like a debit card that is specifically assigned to a content
      provider's website. The Payment Token has a spending limit that is set
      by the customer before being activated. The Payment Token is then assigned
      to a specific website and can only be used by that website until the
      spending limit has been met. Customers are protected by excessive
      fraudulent spending by the spending limit. Content creators are protected
      against excessive damages due to theft of the Payment Token because of
      the spending limit and because Payment Tokens can always be revoked at
      any time by the customer or content website.</p>

      <p>In most cases, stealing a customer's credit card number could result
      in hundreds of dollars in damages. Using PaySwarm, stealing a customer's
      per-website Payment Token may result in damages up to $1. However, whoever
      steals the customer's Payment Token would only be able to transfer money
      into the content creator's financial that owns the Payment Token.
      </p>

      <h3 id="simple">Simple Customer Experience</h3>

      <p>PaySwarm does not require any extra browser software for customers and
      will therefore work in any modern web browser. PaySwarm is
      fully-integrated into your website, which means that you can
      show your customer's how much is left of their spending limit, what
      they've purchased previously, and a variety of other information about
      their spending on your website. The only time a customer is redirected to
      another website is to authorize the Payment Token. The content creator
      stays in control of the experience at all other times.
      </p>

      <h3 id="flexible">Flexible Payments</h3>

      <p>The payments that are allowed using a PaySwarm Payment Token can
      range from thousands of dollars, to pennies, to thousandths of a
      a penny. This enables content creators to charge per year and per book
      down to per second and per article. PaySwarm can be used for macropayments
      as well as micropayments, and allows content creators to determine how
      much or how little to charge their customers.
      </p>

      <h3 id="open">Open and Standards-based</h3>

      <p>PaySwarm is built on top of open or standard Web technologies. There
      are no black-boxes or overly-restrictive digital rights management systems
      involved. All that is required for PaySwarm to operate is HTTP, TLS,
      RDFa and JSON-LD. This ensures full interoperability between different
      implementations. If you'd like to help develop the PaySwarm standard,
      you are urged to <a href="http://payswarm.com/">join the community</a>.
      </p>

      <h3 id="royalty-free">Royalty-free</h3>

      <p>Anyone can implement and use the PaySwarm standard in a patent and
      royalty-free manner. You don't need permission, you don't need to pay
      royalties.
